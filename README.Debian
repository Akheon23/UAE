uae and e-uae
-------------

Note that the Debian package "uae" is based on the "original"
uae homed at http://uae.coresystems.de/. R.C.Drummond's
spinn-off "e-uae" is now packaged separately as "e-uae".

Both packages may be installed at the same time.

As both upstreams use the same default config file ('~/.uaerc'),
the Debian e-uae package is patched to use '~/.e-uaerc' by
default to avoid collisions.

Amiga support
-------------

You may want to use some of your original amiga software, quoting from
the upstream README:

  In the "amiga" subdirectory you'll find two small Amiga programs that will
  help you to generate the necessary image files. These are called transrom
  and transdisk. Copy them to your Amiga and make them executable (by typing
  "protect transrom rwed" and "protect transdisk rwed" in the Amiga shell
  window).

In this distribution the contents of the aforementioned "amiga"
directory can be found in /usr/share/e-uae/amiga.tar.gz

For more info about using those tools please read the upstream
README section named "Tools / Transferring files"
